# Building a PWA with Svelte

This project shows three different ways to build PWAs with Svelte.

- `sapper-pwa` shows how you can build a PWA with [Svelte Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
- `svelte-pwa` shows how you can build a PWA with just [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) by itself
- `sveltekit-pwa` shows how you can build PWAs with [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

This is a companion project to my LogRocket post `Building a PWA with Svelte`.

For the `svelte-pwa` I copied some files from https://github.com/tretapey/svelte-pwa

For the `sveltekit-pwa` I copied some files from the project used in the post [Create a PWA with Sveltekit | Svelte](https://dev.to/100lvlmaster/create-a-pwa-with-sveltekit-svelte-a36).
